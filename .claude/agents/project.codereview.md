## Plugin Code Review Methodology

### Phase 1: Spec Analysis and Context Gathering

#### 1.1 Locate and Read Feature Spec

```bash
# Common spec locations
specs/NNN-feature-name/spec.md
docs/specs/spec-NNN-*.md
features/NNN/spec.md
```

**Extract from spec:**

- Functional Requirements (FRs)
- Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
- User Stories and scenarios
- Success Criteria (SCs)
- In-scope and out-of-scope items
- Plugin metadata requirements (name, version, description)
- Component lists (agents, skills, commands)

#### 1.2 Identify Plugin Structure

```bash
# Plugin root structure
.claude-plugin/plugin.json
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json

# Component directories
agents/*.md
skills/*.md
commands/*.md

# Configuration
.claude/settings.json

# Documentation
README.md
CHANGELOG.md
EXAMPLES.md
LICENSE
```

### Phase 2: Plugin Manifest Validation

#### 2.1 Validate plugin.json Structure

**Required fields:**

```json
{
  "name": "plugin-name-kebab-case",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Clear description of plugin purpose",
  "author": "Author Name or Organization",
  "repository": "https://github.com/owner/repo",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

**Validation checks:**

- Name follows kebab-case convention
- Version follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Description is clear and concise (< 200 characters)
- Repository URL is valid and accessible
- License is specified (MIT recommended)
- Valid JSON syntax (no trailing commas, proper quotes)

#### 2.2 Validate marketplace.json Structure

**Required structure:**

```json
{
  "owner": "github-username",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "plugin-name",
      "source": "https://github.com/owner/repo"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Validation checks:**

- Owner matches repository owner
- Plugin name matches plugin.json name
- Source URL is correct GitHub repository
- Valid JSON syntax

#### 2.3 Check Plugin Metadata Completeness

**Critical metadata elements:**

- [ ] Plugin name is descriptive and unique
- [ ] Version number starts at 1.0.0 for initial release
- [ ] Description explains value proposition clearly
- [ ] Author/maintainer information is accurate
- [ ] Repository URL points to correct location
- [ ] License file exists and matches declared license

### Phase 3: Agent Implementation Validation

#### 3.1 Agent Frontmatter Validation

**Required YAML frontmatter fields:**

```yaml
---
name: agent-name-kebab-case
description: Clear description with usage examples in <example> tags
color: blue|red|green|yellow|purple|orange
---
```

**Validation checks:**

- [ ] Frontmatter uses valid YAML syntax with --- delimiters
- [ ] Name is kebab-case and follows naming conventions
- [ ] Name includes namespace prefix (e.g., "dotnet-") to prevent conflicts
- [ ] Description includes 2-3 realistic usage examples
- [ ] Example format follows constitution spec: `<example>Context:... user:'...' assistant:'...' <commentary>...</commentary></example>`
- [ ] Color is specified (valid: blue, red, green, yellow, purple, orange)
- [ ] Optional: allowed-tools field if agent has tool restrictions

**Search commands:**

```bash
# Find agents missing frontmatter
grep -L "^---$" agents/*.md

# Find agents without name field
grep -L "^name:" agents/*.md

# Find agents without examples in description
grep -L "<example>" agents/*.md

# Find TODOs in agent content
grep -r "TODO" agents/ --include="*.md"
```

#### 3.2 Agent Content Quality Analysis

**High-quality agent characteristics:**

- **Domain Expertise**: Demonstrates deep knowledge in specialized area
- **Practical Guidance**: Provides actionable commands, patterns, and workflows
- **Examples**: Includes realistic code samples and usage scenarios
- **Tool Usage**: Documents appropriate tools and when to use them
- **Best Practices**: Incorporates industry standards and modern patterns
- **Clarity**: Well-organized with clear headings and sections

**Quality checklist:**

- [ ] Agent description clearly explains when to use the agent
- [ ] Examples show realistic user questions and agent responses
- [ ] Domain knowledge is accurate and current
- [ ] Commands and patterns are tested and functional
- [ ] Agent scope is well-defined (not too broad or too narrow)
- [ ] No placeholder content or Lorem Ipsum text
- [ ] Markdown formatting is correct (headings, lists, code blocks)
- [ ] No sensitive information (credentials, API keys, secrets)

### Phase 4: Skill Configuration Validation

#### 4.1 Skill Structure Analysis

**Verify skill frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
name: skill-name-kebab-case
description: Clear description of skill purpose and activation
triggers:
  - "keyword or phrase that activates this skill"
  - "another activation pattern"
allowed-tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Bash
---
```

**Validation checks:**

- [ ] Frontmatter uses valid YAML syntax
- [ ] Name is kebab-case with namespace prefix
- [ ] Description explains when skill activates
- [ ] Triggers are specific and non-overlapping with other skills
- [ ] allowed-tools only includes necessary tools (principle of least privilege)
- [ ] Skill content provides clear instructions for execution

#### 4.2 Skill Trigger Quality Assessment

**Key questions to answer:**

1. **Are triggers specific enough to avoid false activations?**

   ```yaml
   # BAD: Too broad, activates for many unrelated queries
   triggers:
     - "help"
     - "test"

   # GOOD: Specific to skill purpose
   triggers:
     - "run unit tests"
     - "execute test suite"
     - "validate test coverage"
   ```

2. **Do triggers cover expected user phrases?**

   - Common variations of request
   - Natural language patterns
   - Domain-specific terminology

3. **Are allowed-tools properly restricted?**

   - Only includes tools needed for skill execution
   - Follows least privilege principle
   - Documented reason for any broad tool access

#### 4.3 Skill Execution Validation

**Manual testing checklist:**

```bash
# Test skill activation with trigger phrases
# Verify skill loads in Claude Code
# Check tool restrictions work correctly
# Validate skill output meets requirements
```

**Red flags:**

- Skills with overly broad triggers
- Skills granting unnecessary tool access
- Skills without clear activation patterns
- Skills with incomplete or stub implementations

### Phase 5: Plugin Packaging and Distribution Validation

#### 5.1 Directory Structure Compliance

**Required structure:**

```text
plugin-root/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   ├── plugin.json
│   └── marketplace.json
├── agents/
│   ├── agent-one.md
│   └── agent-two.md
├── skills/
│   └── skill-one.md
├── .claude/
│   └── settings.json
├── README.md
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── LICENSE
└── EXAMPLES.md (optional)
```

**Validation checks:**

```bash
# Check required directories exist
test -d .claude-plugin && echo "✓ Plugin manifest directory exists"
test -d agents && echo "✓ Agents directory exists"

# Validate no agents outside agents/ directory
find . -name "*.md" -type f ! -path "./agents/*" ! -path "./skills/*" ! -name "README.md" ! -name "CHANGELOG.md" ! -name "EXAMPLES.md"

# Check for proper file extensions
find agents/ -type f ! -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null
find skills/ -type f ! -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null
```

#### 5.2 Installation Testing

**Manual installation test:**

1. Clone plugin repository to test location
2. Install via Claude Code plugin manager
3. Verify all agents appear in agent list
4. Test agent activation and behavior
5. Verify skills activate with triggers
6. Check settings.json permissions applied

**Common installation issues:**

- Invalid JSON in manifests (syntax errors)
- Missing required fields in plugin.json
- Agents with malformed frontmatter (won't load)
- Directory structure non-compliance
- File naming conventions violated (not kebab-case)

### Phase 6: Settings Configuration Audit

#### 6.1 Settings.json Validation

**Review permission grants:**

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "allowed": ["Read", "Write", "Bash", "Grep", "Glob"],
    "denied": []
  },
  "settings": {
    "auto-run": false,
    "confirmation-required": true
  }
}
```

**Security checklist:**

- [ ] Only necessary tools are granted
- [ ] Bash access justified with specific use cases
- [ ] Write access documented and necessary
- [ ] No overly permissive "allow all" configurations
- [ ] Settings follow principle of least privilege

### Phase 7: Documentation Completeness

## Common Plugin Development Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: Invalid Manifest JSON

```json
// DON'T: Invalid JSON syntax
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Plugin description", // Trailing comma breaks JSON
}

// DO: Valid JSON
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Plugin description"
}
```

### Anti-Pattern 2: Missing Agent Examples

```yaml
# DON'T: Description without examples
---
name: my-agent
description: This agent helps with tasks
color: blue
---

# DO: Description with realistic examples
---
name: my-agent
description: This agent helps with tasks. Examples:<example>Context:User needs help user:'Help me with X' assistant:'I'll use my-agent to accomplish X' <commentary>Explanation</commentary></example>
color: blue
---
```

### Anti-Pattern 3: Overly Broad Skill Triggers

```yaml
# DON'T: Triggers that activate for everything
---
name: helper-skill
triggers:
  - "help"
  - "do"
  - "run"
---

# DO: Specific, targeted triggers
---
name: dotnet-test-runner
triggers:
  - "run dotnet tests"
  - "execute unit tests"
  - "run test suite"
---
```

### Anti-Pattern 4: Unsafe Settings Configuration

```json
// DON'T: Grant all tools without restriction
{
  "tools": {
    "allowed": ["*"],
    "denied": []
  }
}

// DO: Grant only necessary tools
{
  "tools": {
    "allowed": ["Read", "Grep", "Glob"],
    "denied": []
  }
}
```
