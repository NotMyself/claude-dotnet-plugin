# Specification Quality Checklist: Claude .NET Plugin

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Validation Summary

**Status**: PASSED - All quality checks met

**Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1-P3) with independent testability
- Comprehensive functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-020) covering all aspects of plugin creation
- Well-defined success criteria that are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Appropriate assumptions documented
- Edge cases identified for installation and compatibility scenarios

**Observations**:
- Specification correctly focuses on WHAT users need (plugin installation, agent usage, template access)
- No implementation details present - no mention of specific tools, programming patterns, or technical architecture
- User stories are independently testable and prioritized for MVP delivery
- Success criteria use measurable outcomes (time, error rates, user completion)
- Requirements maintain proper abstraction level suitable for non-technical stakeholders

**Ready for Next Phase**: YES
- Proceed with `/speckit.plan` to design implementation approach
- All requirements clear and unambiguous - no clarifications needed
